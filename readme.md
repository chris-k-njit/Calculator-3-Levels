# IS601 - Homework 3 - Calculator of Three Different Levels

## Goals of this Homework Assignment
1. Follow DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
2. Separation of Concerns -- Separate each part that the program needs to do, so it is organized and the functionals only have to do ONE thing.
3. Create new branches for each version of this program
	1. Main Branch / Master Branch - Basic calculators with functions (similar to hw 2).
	2. Branch 2  / Part 2 - A more intermediate Calculator with static methods on Calculator class, instance methods on the Calculation class to perform operations on the data in the calculation instance.
	3. Branch 3  / Part 3 - Advanced Calculator (see comments on Prof. Williams repo for more info).
